          <h1>F1TENTH VICON-Based Autonomous Driving</h1>
          <h2 style="color:#dae9de">ECE 484: Principles of Robotics – Final Team Project</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Tech Stack</strong>: Python, ROS</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            This was a collaborative project completed as part of the ECE 484 course at UIUC. Our team worked with the F1TENTH autonomous vehicle platform—a 1/10th scale racecar equipped with a Jetson NX, VESC motor controller, and access to a VICON motion capture system. The VICON system was already set up to provide real-time, high-accuracy indoor pose tracking.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our goal as a team was to develop a control algorithm that could use the VICON pose data to autonomously drive the car along a predefined set of waypoints. Our focus was on implementing the Pure Pursuit path-tracking controller in Python and integrating it with ROS so the car could respond to its position in real time.
          </p>

          <p>
            The project required close coordination, needing waypoint planning, data visualizationand control logic and ROS topic management. Together, we debugged the system, ran live tests in the VICON-equipped lab, and refined our parameters through trial and error.
          </p>

          <h2>System Functionality</h2>
          <p>
            The controller subscribes to VICON pose data (position + orientation), converts quaternions to Euler angles, and calculates the appropriate steering angle using a Pure Pursuit algorithm. The system then publishes steering and throttle commands to the vehicle’s drive system through standard ROS topics.
          </p>

          <p>
            The main challenges we faced involved tuning the lookahead distance and ensuring stability at higher speeds, as well as accounting for temporary VICON data loss or latency. Testing in a live lab environment gave us valuable experience in dealing with real-world system quirks.
