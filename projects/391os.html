          <h1>ECE 391 Operating System Development</h1>
          <h2 style="color:#dae9de">ECE 391: Computer Systems Engineering – Final Project (Team)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Tech Stack</strong>: C, x86 Assembly, GCC, GDB, QEMU</li>
            <li><strong>Platform</strong>: x86 Protected Mode, Custom Kernel</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            As a team of four, we built a functional Unix-like operating system kernel from scratch for x86 protected mode. The project covered the full stack of OS development—from memory management and task scheduling to file system interaction and hardware-level device drivers. We deployed and tested the OS using QEMU and debugged it with GDB.
          </p>

          <h2>Collaborative Focus</h2>
          <p>
            Our team divided responsibilities across major subsystems. One member focused on memory and paging, another implemented device and terminal drivers, and I worked primarily on the file system and process control structures. We coordinated our integration weekly, using Git for version control and debugging together during late-night QEMU/GDB sessions.
          </p>

          <h2>Key Features</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>System Call Layer:</strong> Implemented syscall wrappers and handlers for user-space apps to interact with kernel functionality (`read`, `write`, `open`, `close`, `execute`, etc.).</li>
            <li><strong>Paging Mechanism:</strong> Enabled 4MB paging to isolate user and kernel memory, configured via CR3 and page directory structures.</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-Terminal Support:</strong> Enabled seamless switching between three independent terminals, each maintaining its own shell and screen state.</li>
            <li><strong>Preemptive Scheduling:</strong> Built a round-robin scheduler triggered via timer interrupts to cycle between user processes.</li>
            <li><strong>File System Implementation:</strong> Developed a FAT-like read-only file system with directory and inode-based access to program binaries and text files.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>What We Learned</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Low-Level Collaboration:</strong> Worked effectively as a team to integrate assembly, C, and hardware interactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Interrupt-Driven Architecture:</strong> Gained hands-on experience with IRQs, PICs, and timer-based process switching.</li>
            <li><strong>Protected Memory:</strong> Used paging to protect kernel and user-space memory with privilege enforcement.</li>
            <li><strong>Process Control:</strong> Built a minimal process table, TSS usage, and shell launching framework.</li>
            <li><strong>Debugging in QEMU:</strong> Used GDB extensively to resolve low-level memory and pointer bugs, including stack issues and IDT faults.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            ECE 391 was one of the most challenging and rewarding courses in our undergraduate curriculum. By building a kernel-level OS from scratch, we developed strong systems-level thinking and a practical understanding of how hardware interfaces with software—skills that have carried forward into real world software engineering. The project taught us the importance of low-level programming, debugging, and collaborative development in creating robust systems.
