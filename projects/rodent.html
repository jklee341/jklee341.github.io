            <h2>The Challenge: Protecting Our Lawns</h2>
            <p>
              Every year, homeowners and businesses face the frustrating problem of rodents and birds digging up lawns, golf courses, and gardens. This not only ruins the aesthetic of the landscape but also causes significant damage to turf and plants. Current deterrents on the market are often simplistic, using loud, untargeted noises that are disruptive and ultimately ineffective, leaving users with a damaged lawn and no information about the specific pest causing the problem.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Solution: An Intelligent and Targeted System</h2>
            <p>
              To solve this, we developed an intelligent rodent detection and deterrent system that offers a modern, effective, and informative approach. Our system is built to perform three key actions in real-time: detect an intruder, accurately classify the type of animal, and deploy a humane, targeted deterrent to encourage it to leave the area. This ensures a smarter, more efficient way to protect your property and informs the user about the animals responsible.
            </p>

            <h2>Advanced Technology in Action</h2>
            <p>
              Our system uses a rotating sensor head equipped with infrared and ultrasonic sensors to continuously scan a 360-degree field of view for any unusual activity. Once movement is detected, a Raspberry Pi camera captures a clear image. This image is instantly processed by an advanced software model using YOLOv5 and OpenCV, which can identify the animal with over 95% accuracy. If the intruder is classified as a ground-digging rodent, the system activates a localized deterrent consisting of flashing colored lights and variable ultrasonic sound waves aimed directly at the animal, a significant improvement over single-direction commercial methods.
            </p>

            <h2>Built for Reliability and Performance</h2>
            <p>
              Every component of this project was designed for durability and consistent performance. A robust mechanical subsystem with a minimum RPM of 10 enables the device to continually monitor its surroundings. A dedicated power subsystem provides stable, regulated voltage from a 120v wall connector to protect sensitive electronics like the Raspberry Pi. We conducted a thorough tolerance analysis to ensure all components, from the microcontrollers to the ultrasonic speaker, would operate reliably under real-world conditions. This engineering focus guarantees the system is not just a clever concept, but a long-lasting and effective solution.
            </p>

            <h2>A Commitment to Ethical and Safe Design</h2>
            <p>
              Safety and ethics were guiding principles throughout the design process. Our design adheres to the ACM Code of Ethics by prioritizing the well-being of animals. The system is committed to the humane treatment of animals, using harmless light and sound cues to modify behavior rather than cause injury. The sound frequencies are outside the range of human hearing to avoid being a nuisance, and the light intensity is calibrated to be startling but not harmful. We also integrated multiple safety features, including enclosed moving parts and a protected casing for any batteries, to ensure the device is safe for users, animals, and the environment.
            </p>

            <h2>Key Learnings from Rodent Deterrence System Project</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Iterative Hardware Design & Debugging:</strong> 
      Learned to design and revise a custom PCB, perform voltage regulation calculations, and troubleshoot issues like low output voltage from an LDO regulator.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Adaptive System Architecture:</strong> 
      Adapted the microcontroller strategy from ESP32 to Raspberry Pi 4 based on real-world testing, compatibility issues, and system performance requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Sensor Integration & Environmental Mapping:</strong> 
      Integrated motion sensors, ultrasonic range finders, and cameras to map surroundings and detect objects in real time, forming the core of the detection logic.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Automation & Logic Development:</strong> 
      Designed and implemented a sequential logic pipeline: motion detection → scanning → object tracking → activation of the deterrent system.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Prototyping & Real-World Validation:</strong> 
      Assembled and tested the full system in outdoor conditions, successfully identifying and deterring squirrels using ultrasonic sound and lights.
    </li>
